<p><strong>Beacon</strong> is an app for letting friends know passively, when friends are available to hangout.  The app provides each person with a “beacon” that they can turn on or off.  Friends can see when friends beacons are on.  To get someone’s attention you can send a signal
to show interest.</p>

<h4 id="the-idea">The Idea</h4>

<p>In early 2014, my friend Glen had a wonderful and simple thought.  We had friends who were always left out, despite the fact that people were more than happy to hangout with them.  Since they were introverted by nature, they never actively sought out others or made themselves known when get togethers were being organized. The initial idea for Beacon came from the question “How can we get introverts to hang out?” How could we let introverts stay in character, while also letting their friends know that they were available to hang out? What we came up with was Beacon.  Let’s take away the need to send out emails or texts, just let them flip a little switch, and their friends will know they’re down.</p>

<h4 id="early-designs">Early designs</h4>

<p>Initial designs for Beacon made it clear that we could make this a super simple experience.  There were very little elements that required displaying, and the main action was a switch.</p>

<p>Over time, even what was first believed to be simple, ended up being made even simpler.  I stripped nearly all the chrome out, and it created a much more focused experience.  </p>

<p>Ultimately I settled on a grid based design, for two major reasons. First, it allowed users to see more beacons at once.  The stacked view was simple, but it lacked the same kind of utility as the grid, since it forced users to scroll if they had more than three friends. Second, it emphasized the personal aspect of app by giving more real estate to the portraits of friends.  It’s one thing to see a list of friend’s names, and another to see their shining faces.</p>

<h4 id="prototyping">Prototyping</h4>

<p>Some time during the design phase, Koen Bok and his team elite released FramerJS.  It was (and continues to be) an amazing tool.  Suddenly, interactions became much more accessible to create.  Here are some of the interactions that I came up with.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>Beacon is a project about getting to the essentials.  If there is no need for additional complexity, why introduce it?  Give just enough, and what you have will speak louder than ever.  The final app is a plain grid of faces with a small beacon icon beside it, either on or off. </p>
