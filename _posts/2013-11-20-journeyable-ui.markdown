**Journeyable** is a special little app for planning and sharing your trips. It was my first foray into frontend MVC with emberJS.  This project was placed on hiatus after realizing that the repeatability of itinerary creation is actually quite low. That said, it was a fun exercise in thinking through a problem and getting my feet wet building an app.

I may return to this project someday :)
