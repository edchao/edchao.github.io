**Journeyable** is a special little app for planning and sharing your trips. It is currently in development and on its way to you. Seen here is the mobile version of the site. The early web version, a snapshot of which can be seen below, was my first experimentation with emberjs. <a href="http://journeyable.com"> More to come</a> :)
