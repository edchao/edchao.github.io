As of this moment, there are still no good solutions for discovering places.  During my time at Guidebook, I had the privilege of working with some really talented folks (Mike Sprague, Filip Kaliszan) to create an experience that might change that.

#### The Problem

The problem we set out to tackle was, how do we get people to explore places on their phone in a fun and highly addictive way?  And as they explore how can we progressively taylor their experience so that the app grows in its value for that person?

#### Imagining the use cases

Filip had been brewing up this product in his mind for awhile, and he had thought of two major use cases.  The first, dreaming of going to a place and the second, actually being at a place.  In each scenario,  we wanted to address the question, how do you go about learning about the place you are at?

#### Making places manageable

Places.  That's a massive concept.  There are tons of angles and subcategories for a place.  How could we break "places" down into a manageable and easily consumable thing?  And how could we do this with the least amount of effort from a user?  

One thing we could do without user effort is detect where they were, at least on a city level.  And with that information we could serve them information about that city/region.  

But even a city is a massive concept.  So we broke down a city into the categories of offerings that city has.  Food, Museums, Sights, etc.  Great! So how do we serve this information?

#### Lists, Grids and Cards

How to manifest places to users can go many different ways.  The simplest idea is just to list them.  But lists are inherently non-engaging, and extremely limited in what they can convey.  What is engaging is images.  So we tried a grid of images.  But the problem with grids is that it's overwhelming.  You run into the paradox of choice.  So the next option was stacks of cards.  You can only view one card at a time.  That's manageable. And to give it another dimension, we created multiple stacks. Each stack represents a category for the place where you are at.   Swiping up and down switches your stack category.

#### Information Cards

The wonderful thing about cards, is that it modularizes information.  It makes things bite sized.  That's just what we wanted for our details screen.  If you want to look at a monument, or a museum, there are a ton of things you can learn about them.  So why don't we organize all those things into cards that summarize information? If you want to read more about it, then tap it, otherwise a quick scan will afford you the information you need.

#### Feeling like a single screen app

In order to maintain a feeling of simplicity, I felt it was important to make the app essentially a single screen experience.  To do this, drill down interactions were repackaged into expanding cards.  This way you don't feel like you're leaving the main screen, you're just magnifying an element on it.
