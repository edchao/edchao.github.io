Frame is a 16 column responsive grid that scales across pixel width intervals of 300, 768, 960, and 1440. As a little extra, I put in a horizontal grid which I call bricks.  They are simple horizontal spacers that allow you to protoype formatting much quicker. You can download it [here]({{http://thatedchao.com}}/assets/frame.zip).
