<!--more-->

<strong>ForAgainst</strong> lets you post reasons why you are for or against any issue. Contribute an issue, post a reason, or upvote/downvote reasons other people have posted.  As time goes by, you decide which side is most compelling.

This was my first time developing in Swift and Parse so the app still has a ways to go.  On top of what's already there, I would eventually like to allow users to create groups so that issues and reasons can be shared exclusively amongst friends. If you're interested in testing <strong> ForAgainst</strong> out, <a href="https://twitter.com/edchao"> send me a tweet</a>.
