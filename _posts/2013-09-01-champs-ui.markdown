**Champs : Battlegrounds** is a Multiplayer Online Squad Strategy mobile game.  It's available on both tablet and smart phones (iOS + Android). I had lots of fun designing the UI for this game.  It was a great opportunity to show that games don't have to have overly convoluted user interfaces.  Check it out <a href="http://champsgame.com">here.</a>

**The kill collection heads-up display (Above).**  Each time a character is killed, the soul is swept up into this display pushing up the number.  When ten kills are reached, the game ends.

**The Ability HUD (Above).** Originally we wanted a circle hud to access and execute abilities (Above) because it allowed a user to easily identify which character the hud belonged to.  However after numerous user tests, I settled on creating a more intuitive version which exists as a magnified representation of the character's energy bar.
