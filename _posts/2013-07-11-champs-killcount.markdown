This is an image showing how the killcount UI changed over time (from top to bottom).  At first I put together something that was pretty lazy. I just pulled some textures together and formed them into useful shapes that could house the score content.  It was essentially a glorified wireframe.  A few days went by...and then I just couldn't live with it.  So I decided to actually give it some individual treatment. Honestly, I should have just done this from the beginning.
