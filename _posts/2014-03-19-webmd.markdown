You know, I like WebMD quite a bit.  They provide a valuable and expansive source of medical information which I always find myself getting linked to. That said, I do wish could sift through it better. Barring any major branding changes here is a modest proposal for a webMD with a little more information hierarchy and touch of visual restraint.

Disclaimer: The webMD trademark belongs to webMD. The Lilly trademark belongs to Lilly.  The Mucinex trademark belongs to Mucinex.  The Covered California Trademark belongs to Covered California. And Patrick Cobb, MD owns his ad. Makes sense.
